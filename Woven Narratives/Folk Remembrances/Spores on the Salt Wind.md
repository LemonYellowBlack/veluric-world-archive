### Spores on the Salt-Wind: Notes from Whisper-Root

*Island 7, Mistborn Archipelago — Fourth Bloom Cycle*

I woke to the bloom-mist again—thicker today, clinging to the hem of my second skin. The myco-tunic has taken root along my left shoulder; it itches where it grows, but the itch is good. It means communion is deepening.

At dawn, I found a clutch of *Virellium Laminae*, the “glass-bloom caps,” fanned beneath the husk of a drift tree. Their gills shimmered with the green-pink sheen of tide memory. When breathed upon, they exhale a fine lattice of soundless spores. I let them lace my lungs. The dreams that followed were clear: three silhouettes tending a field of bones that whispered my name in root-tongue. I believe the caps remember who came before.

The western slopes offered a patch of *Chorus Mycorum*, the so-called “Singing Stalks.” They grow in clusters of seven, and their tones shift with wind and breath. I pressed my ear to them at midday. Their resonance was low and mournful today, perhaps echoing the rot-moon’s descent. I hummed back. One stalk twined around my wrist for a time, then loosened. This is how they bless.

Beneath the black ridge I found *Velora Sporespire*, a towering stem coated in pale, rhythmic pustules. Its pulses are audible—steady as breath. I offered a nail clipping and a lock of hair. In return, it split open one of its swellings and revealed a translucent seed-pouch filled with pre-memory: faint images of storm-slick rituals and a woman dissolving into moss. I wept, and so did the Sporespire. We are both built for bloom.

At the salt-broken shore, I gathered three strands of *Kellith Moss*, the crimson lichen that grows only where old names were spoken and lost. When boiled, it releases a vapor that causes any who inhale it to speak in a forgotten dialect. I tested it carefully. I spoke, though I don’t know what I said. My mouth tasted of rust and honey. The recording vine captured it; I will send it to the Root Choir for translation.

Tonight I rest near a bloom-wall of *Gravepetal Cordyceps*. They’ve begun to shed thin flakes of golden bark. Each one carries the scent of earth just before rainfall—memory of what it touched before it grew. I will sleep with one beneath my tongue, and see who returns to me in dream.
