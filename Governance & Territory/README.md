# Governance & Territory  
A record of structure, stewardship, and spatial memory.

This collection contains documents, maps, and codices that define the political and civic architecture of Velureth and its echoes. It preserves the principles of governance practiced across Orders, the evolution of territorial domains, and the bureaucratic frameworks that maintain alignment or dissent. From sacred jurisdictions to administrative relics, these works serve as both legal reference and metaphysical memory.

## Contents

### The Civic Foundations  
Frameworks of law, governance, and institutional continuity—both historical and contemporary. Includes procedural doctrines, ruling systems by Order, and the civic philosophies behind each.

### Territorial Mappings  
Cartographic renderings and geomantic records of Veluric space. Includes Order-aligned territories, shifting borders, echo-fields, and geospatial anomalies of metaphysical importance.

### Administrative Records  
Treatises, decrees, census fragments, and infrastructural reports that shaped or responded to civil life. Many documents carry signs of revision, marginalia, or resonance-based redaction.

*To govern a world thrice named is to listen not only to its people—but to its soil, its breath, and its vanishing.*
