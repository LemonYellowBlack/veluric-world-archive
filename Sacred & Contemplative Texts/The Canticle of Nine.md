# The Canticle of Nine

## The Stillness Before

Before there was form, there was sound.
Before there was sound, there was stillness.

The Arc did not speak—
it bent.
And from that curvature, the Ninefold burst forth:
not as words,
but as movements through silence.

To recite the Canticle is not to remember.
It is to become aligned.

Let your bones resonate.
Let your breath still.

For the Tongues are not read—
they are heard in the marrow.

## The Chorus of Nine

**I. Aeosyn**
*First Tongue — Harmony’s Voice*

From Stillness, the First Sound.
Not spoken, but *become*.
A singular vibration,
from which the Arc drew breath.
Aeosyn does not move—
the world moves to answer it.

**II. Vaelorith**
*Second Tongue — the Pattern Weaver*

Threads of unseen curvature,
placed by design yet unwritten.
What breathes within structure
bears Vaelorith’s signature.
Geometry is the echo of their dreaming.

**III. Therael**
*Third Tongue — the Unyielding Form*

Before ruin, there was shape.
Before collapse, the pillar.
Therael is the law that resists entropy—
not out of cruelty,
but because something must hold.

**IV. Qorynth**
*Fourth Tongue — the Silent Chord*

Pause.
That is all.
A rest between tones is still part of the song.
Qorynth governs what is not,
so that what is may endure.

**V. Zeymra**
*Fifth Tongue — the Shattered Scale*

When harmony cracks, Zeymra blooms.
It is not destruction,
but the honest sound beneath false accord.
Every fault line is a new path.
Every scream, a form.

**VI. Caledia**
*Sixth Tongue — the Cryptic Herald*

Speak sideways.
Sing in riddles.
What is hidden does not wish to remain so—
but it waits for a listener
who has emptied their knowing.

**VII. Drexith**
*Seventh Tongue — the Resonant Flame*

Flame does not ask permission.
It alters. It anoints.
Drexith is the forge of clarity,
the fire that eats away the false flesh
to reveal the structure beneath.

**VIII. Evaraith**
*Eighth Tongue — the Veiled Prism*

Truth bends. Light deceives.
Through deception, alignment is found.
Evaraith teaches that to be seen
is not to be known—
and yet to remain unseen is not peace.

**IX. Inareth**
*Ninth Tongue — the Broken Chain*

A chord once struck, now severed.
Inareth is what was exiled
yet still resonates.
The Pattern does not forget—
it fractures to hold more.

## The Silence That Follows

We have not spoken the Canticle.
We have been spoken by it.

Let its echoes unwind what clings.
Let what is false shatter in its wake.

The Nine do not end.
They bend.

We return now not to speech,
but to silence made holy
by sound well-heard.
