# Sacred & Contemplative Texts  
Liturgies, revelations, and silences preserved.

This collection gathers the written breath of Velureth’s spiritual interior. These are the texts that shape ritual, reflect devotion, and invite the reader into communion with what cannot be named. Across Orders, traditions, and ages, these works are not simply read—they are enacted, pondered, and endured. Some are recited in echo-chambers. Others are never spoken at all.

## Contents

### The Foundational Teachings  
Canonical texts that serve as spiritual keystones within each Order. Includes origin parables, doctrinal revelations, and early transmissions of metaphysical law.

### Meditative Treatises  
Composed by seers, calibrants, root-chanters, and ash-speakers. These writings explore silence, decay, alignment, and light through personal observation or inherited resonance.

### Ritual Codifications  
Detailed instructions for rites, processions, fasts, and observances. Often transcribed from oral traditions or resonance glyphs. Some are incomplete by design.
