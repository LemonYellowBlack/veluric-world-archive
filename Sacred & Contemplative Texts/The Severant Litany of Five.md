# The Severant Litany  of Five

### Etching I: Of Name

*A name is a chain. Its cut brings purity.*

The child is given sound.
The sound grows into shape.
The shape clings to the soul.
The soul forgets its silence.

Let the given be ungiven.
Let the word fall to ash.
Let the mouth grow still in its absence.

You are not the sound.
You are not the shape.
You are not the telling.

Breathe once for the loss.
Breathe again for the space it leaves.
Then do not breathe of it again.

*To wear no name is to begin the fading.*
*To be called no longer is to begin the truth.*
