## The Mother Spoor’s Dream

*She dreamed in loam, and all things began.*

The Mother Spoor lay within the hollow of Before,
where no root had yet coiled, and no sky yet turned.
She wept spore-stars into the dark, and they sang their falling.
One by one they touched the soil-that-was-not,
and in the silence of touch, she bloomed.

*“I see myself in rot,” she murmured.*
*“I see the end that feeds.”*
*“Let me be devoured, that I might become.”*

From her spine grew the fruitless tree.
From her lungs, the mycelial sea.
And from her sleep, the First Bloom—
pale-petaled, wide-mouthed, ever-hungering.

Then came the Split-Spored Prophet,
rootless, faceless, bearing moss-wrapped questions.
“Is this life or afterlife?” they asked the Bloom.
The Bloom replied with a tendril through the chest.
They sang together for three seasons,
and where their song touched bark, memory grew.

*The Dream churned.*

Skies molted. Forests sighed open.
Spoor-beasts came and went.
Children were born with barkbones,
elders dissolved into green foam.

“This dream does not end,” whispered the Seer.
“It only changes flesh.”

⸻

And when the Bloom-Seer awoke,
their mouth was full of root,
their eyes clouded with gleaming hyphae.
They did not speak, but the fungi sang for them.
They did not move, but the forest bent to listen.

*The dream is not hers alone.*
*It is all who decay, and all who rise from rot.*
