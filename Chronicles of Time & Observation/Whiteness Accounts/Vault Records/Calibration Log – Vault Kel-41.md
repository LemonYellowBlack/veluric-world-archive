**Calibration Log – Vault Kel-41**
**Cycle 77.22.14 / Third Phase / Subtier 19-Kar**
**Filed under Resonance Oversight: Calith, Lineage Rhyn (provisional)**

**Primary Array Readings**
* *Vibricore Stabilization Thread:* 0.0037Hz drift over standard threshold.
* *Tessellated Lattice (Chamber V-KR2):* Reactive hum at 11.1 subharmonic, consistent with prior decay readings.
* *Echo-Plate Aural Profile:* Contained tone-cycle failed to complete decay loop—residual resonance lingered 0.7 seconds longer than modelled.
* *Glass-Tuned Harmometer:* Noted minor misalignment (rotational axis skew: 0.041°). Recalibrated.

**Manual Corrections Applied**
* Adjusted Primary Conduction Spire using Null-Tuning Rod (v.3.5). Dissonant feedback momentarily spiked upon contact. No visible fault in vibric structure.
* Engaged low-frequency rebalance via the secondary null-rod; standard inversion pulse cleared anomaly in Chamber V-KR2, but left faint aftertone in personal auditory field. Logged for reevaluation.
* Reinscribed minor pattern fracture near Archive Door C-Delta using micro-filament stylus; glyph structure resistant to rebind, suggesting preexisting harmonic instability.

**Observations**
Recalibration was successful. No other anomalies detected.

**Action Required**
* Recommend mnemonic trace-sweep across Subvault 7-Ae.
* Awaiting authorization for deeper harmonic scan beyond standard civic bounds. (Request previously deferred by Harmonarch Vor-Ken.)
